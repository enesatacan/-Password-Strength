# ðŸ’» Daily JavaScript App - Day 23: Password Strength

ðŸŒŸ Part of my Daily JavaScript Coding Challenge, where I create a new JavaScript project every day! The aim? Sharpening my skills ðŸ§  and staying consistent in coding. ðŸš€

## Password Strength Checker

This project allows users to check the strength of their passwords as they type. The password strength is determined based on its length and provides visual feedback to the user.

## Features

- **Real-Time Feedback:** The password strength is automatically evaluated while the user types.
- **Visual Feedback:** The password strength is indicated using color codes (weak, medium, strong).
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Features a clean and modern design.

## Usage

1. **HTML:** The password input field is implemented in the `index.html` file.
2. **CSS:** Styling and color adjustments are handled in the `style.css` file.
3. **JavaScript:** Password strength logic and feedback functionality are implemented in the `app.js` file.

## Password Strength Criteria

- **Weak:** Password length is less than 4 characters.
- **Medium:** Password length is between 4 and 7 characters.
- **Strong:** Password length is 8 characters or more.
